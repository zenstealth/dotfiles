Less awkward prefix keys
To change your prefix from C-b to C-a, simply add following lines to your tmux.conf:

# remap prefix from 'C-b' to 'C-a'
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

Sane Split Commands
# split panes using | and -
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v
unbind '"'
unbind %
